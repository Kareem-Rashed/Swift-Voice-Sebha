Voice-Activated Sebha App

Overview

This project is a Voice-Activated Sebha App created using Swift. It serves as a digital version of the traditional Sebha, a prayer bead used in Islamic practices, while also incorporating a modern twist: a voice activation feature that allows users to recite the Sebhas (prayers) out loud. The app has two main modes:

	1.	Traditional Sebha Mode – A digital version of the traditional Sebha that allows users to track their prayer count.
	2.	Voice Mode – A feature where users can recite Sebhas out loud, and the app will listen and count them.

Features

	•	Voice Recognition: The app listens for Sebha recitations and counts them.
	•	Traditional Sebha Mode: Provides a visual interface for users to simulate the traditional Sebha beads.
	•	Counter Reset: Option to reset the counter and start a new session.
	•	Customizable Settings: Customize the number of beads or recitations per session.

Technologies Used

	•	Programming Language: Swift
	•	IDE: Xcode
	•	Voice Recognition: Implemented using iOS speech recognition frameworks.
	•	UI Framework: UIKit

Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Kareem-Rashed/Voice-Activated-Sebha-App.git


	2.	Open the Project:
Open the SebhaApp.xcodeproj file in Xcode.
	3.	Build and Run:
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, and then build and run the project on a physical iOS device (voice recognition may not work on the simulator).

How It Works

	1.	Traditional Mode: This mode simulates the traditional bead counting. Tap on the bead to count each recitation, and the app will keep track of the total number.
	2.	Voice Mode: In this mode, the app listens to your voice and counts the Sebhas as you recite them aloud. The app uses speech recognition to detect the words and increments the count accordingly.

Future Improvements

	•	Add reminders or notifications for users to prompt recitations.
	•	Enhance the voice recognition feature to improve accuracy.
	•	Support for multi-language recitations for a wider audience.
 	•	Online Stats with friends.
